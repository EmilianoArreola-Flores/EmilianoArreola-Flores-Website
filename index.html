        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Emiliano Arreola-Flores and I am the eldest of two children. Growing up as the oldest came with its challenges that I would later appreciate. As I got older I would inherit responsibilities that would ease the lives of my family. With their limited knowledge of English at the time, I would have to work extra hard to perform well in academics. Not to mention, I matured from an early age due to how much I would assist my parents. Coming from a hard-working family has instilled the importance of education and hard work into my personal values from a very young age. These core values are the reason I was able to preserve throughout my academic career and have molded me into a confident and compassionate person. It is for this reason that I have decided that I want my career to consist of helping others and I thought the science field was a perfect opportunity to do so. As a result, I spent most of my high school years taking science and math courses.<br><br>

        My passion for education and helping others can be traced back to my pre-college days. Whether as a member of my high schoolâ€™s Academic Decathlon team or president of Key Club, whose goal is to enhance leadership skills through service. My goal has always been to excel and better prepare myself not only in academics but in character development in order to succeed in my aspirations. Key Club, Academic Decathlon, and other educational clubs that I was a part of were a great learning experience and have positively impacted my life. To begin with, it developed teamwork skills such as communication, reliability, and respectfulness which I can utilize for the rest of my life. Not to mention, these clubs have taught me the importance of compassion towards others. To clarify, in Key Club, I was presented with opportunities to help people make their lives a little bit better whether it was donating toys to kids for Christmas or providing company at nursing homes. It is moments like these that have defined me as a person and influenced my goals in life.  <br><br>

        As of now, I am a first-year biochemistry major at the University of California Riverside. I chose to be a biochemistry major because of its importance to medical science and due to how interesting I find the content. I decided to attend the University of California Riverside not only because of its distance from home but because of its positive reputation. Furthermore, I plan to participate in school clubs such as Healthy Hearts. Ultimately, I believe that the University of California Riverside has all the resources for me to succeed. In the future, my hope is to apply to medical school in order to be a physician or medical expert. As a doctor, I would be able to apply all the hard work and experience I have accumulated over the years in order to do what I love most, which is to help others.
